TAX_RATE = 0.20
STANDARD_DEDUCTION = 10000.0
DEPENDENT_DEDUCTION = 3000.0

#Inputs

numDependents = int(input("Enter the number of dependents: "))

#Compute
TaxableIncome = grossIncome - STANDARD_DEDUCTION - DEPENDENT_DEDUCTION  * numDependents
incomeTax = TaxableIncome * TAX_RATE

#Output
print("The income tax is $" + str(round(incomeTax, 2)))
