Average
1. The input is
        Ask the user what file he wants to access to calculate the numbersâ€™ average in the file.
2. Computations
        Read the file
        Use the data to calculate the average of the numbers
        Simplify the design by using two higher-order functions
3. Outputs:
        Output the average of the numbers as a string.
